This example is related to a specific issue in the Kedro Databricks repository where certain fields did not get properly overridden in the `kedro_databricks` configuration. The example demonstrates how to set up a custom task that uses the `kedro_databricks` package, but it intentionally includes a broken configuration to illustrate the issue.

This issue has been fixed in the `kedro-databricks` package, and the example serves as a reference for users who may encounter similar issues in their own projects.
